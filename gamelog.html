            The first thing I want to change is the landscape, I couldn't paint the landscape with different textures that is why the mountains and the ground looks so simple and not realistic. I also want to add different types of enemies like flying and tank enemies. Lastly, I want to improve the map by adding more props.</p>

        <div class="textboxlog1"><h1>My plan is to add animation and health bar to the enemies to make it more realistic and challenging. And also want to add a wave system to make it more interactive and entertaining. In the current version of the game there is enemies that wait until they see you and attack.</p>
        Also I want to add more objectives like connecting wires by dragging them or solving puzzles to fix wires.</p>
