        <div class="textboxre"><h1>In my game I was inspired from Risk of Rain 2. In the game there is cartoony graphics and various robot enemies and a feeling of a different planet. The rouge-like gameplay is entertaining and keeps the player on the game by giving the feeling of improvement and progress at the same level and with same enemies.</p>
            I used the 2 tone shader I saw on Youtube that has a similar feeling to the one in Risk of Rain 2 and The Legend of Zelda. In my opinion this shader adds the game a special feeling.</p>

        <div class="textboxre1"><h1>I researched enemy ai movements, importing fbx files from Sketchfab, making landscapes and texturing them as well as objectives for help the player find their way to exit.
                I also got inspiration from other youtube videos from other game developers and blender tutorials.</p>
